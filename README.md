# ASD-Project
My project for "Algortimi e Strutture Dati" for the year 2023/24 @ UNIBO
This project was made with my professor model, I projectTests were not made by me
What I coded: The functions of the files in datastructure (but not the structure), the function "compute" in Kruskal.java and the sorting algorithms inside "sorting". I also made a few changes to the original model, but they are explained above "compute".

Making <D> a comparable type was probably not necessary, since the way union finds work already eiminate the problem I was trying to fix entirely!
It helped me debug the code, since it didn't make worse the efficiency I decided to leave it as is

Project finished 18/08/2024, and uploaded 25/08/2024
If used for the same uni project good luck and don't copy paste it!! Use it as a guide :)
